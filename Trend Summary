In terms of the observed Survival Rate of mice during treatment, the Ketapril and Infubinol trends were entangled with the trend of the Placebo drug, with Infubinol performing about 10% worse than both Ketapril and the Placebo, which ended on nearly the same point. 

While Infubinol had a similar Survival Rate as the Placebo, it did have a lesser Metastatic Spread than both the Placebo and Ketapril, which again ended with nearly identical figures.

All three of the top performing drugs and the Placebo had relatively small standard errors for the Tumor Volume Response to Treatment, but moderate standard errors for the Metastatic Spread During Treatment. Relative to the other three, Capomulin still had a relatively small std error, whereas the range of the error for the others was much wider.
